/**
    
TypeScript supports three access modifiers - public, private, and protected.

1.  Public - By default, members (properties and methods) of the TypeScript class are 
    public - so you donâ€™t need to prefix members with the public keyword. 
    Public members are accessible everywhere without restrictions even from the 
    multiple level sub-classes without any compile errors.

2.  Private - A private member cannot be accessed outside of its containing class. 
    Private members can be accessed only within the class and even their sub-classes 
    won't be allowed to use their private properties and attributes.

3.  Protected - A protected member cannot be accessed outside of its containing class. 
    Protected members can be accessed only within the class and by the 
    instance of its sub/child class.

/**
 * Abstract Classes and Methods
 *
 * Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived.
 * They may not be instantiated directly. Unlike an interface,
 * an abstract class may contain implementation details for its members.
 * The abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes
 * as well as abstract methods within an abstract class.
